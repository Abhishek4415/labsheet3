Problem Description  
1. Implementing Stacks and Queues:  
o Implement a stack using both array-based and linked list-based approaches.  
o Implement a queue using both array-based and linked list-based approaches.  
2. Applications:  
o System Stack: Simulate the call stack of a program using the stack implementation. Write a 
function to display the state of the stack at any point.  
o Reversing Data: Use a stack to reverse the contents of a given string.  
o Queue Management in Systems: Simulate a basic print queue system where documents are 
enqueued and dequeued for printing.

Instructions  
1. Stack Implementation:  
o Create a class ArrayStack with methods for push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.  
o Create a class LinkedListStack with methods for push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.  
2. Queue Implementation:  
o Create a class ArrayQueue with methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.  
o Create a class LinkedListQueue with methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.  
3. System Stack Simulation:  
o Write a function that simulates the system stack for a simple program with nested function 
calls.  
4. Reversing Data:  
o Write a function reverseString that takes a string as input and uses a stack to reverse its 
characters.  
5. Queue Management Simulation:  
o Write a class PrintQueue to simulate a print queue. Include methods to add documents to 
the queue and to process them.
